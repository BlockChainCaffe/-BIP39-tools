# BIP39 Tools

Some simple tools to experiment, study and use Bitcoin's BIP39 see phrases.

You might use these to:
- generate a private key from random noise (use at your own risk)
- generate a private key from rolling any type of dice (not just d6)
- derive the BIP39 seed phrase from the private key
- ... more to come in the future maybe, just ask
